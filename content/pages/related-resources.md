-------------------------------

The L-functions and Modular Forms Database is an extensive online database of mathematical objects arising in number theory, including number fields, elliptic curves, modular forms, _L_\-functions and more.

{{% resource_link "01f77c51-06bb-447e-b0ec-7b3aff471f15" "Magma" %}}
-------------------------------------------------------

Magma is a closed-source computer algebra system focused on number theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry. There is a handy {{% resource_link "4004a325-8379-4870-a0d1-b8bc338547de" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations, and a command line interface that you can run from many of the math department servers (type **magma** at the command line).

------------------------------------------

PARI/GP is an open-source computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory. PARI is a fast C-library and GP is a script language interface to PARI that runs in an interactive shell (command-line only, no browser interface). Many Sage functions are implemented using PARI (you can directly call PARI and GP functions from within Sage). Like Magma, PARI/GP also has an {{% resource_link "41735bf9-7178-4945-9ed0-958762389e42" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations.

------------------------------------

Sage is an open-source computer algebra system that includes extensive support for number theory. {{% resource_link "884542ef-40ff-4bfc-b940-20ab5b287aeb" "CoCalc" %}} (formerly SageMathCloud) provides a notebook interface to Sage that runs in any browser and is hosted in the cloud; no software installation is required and there is no cost to register for an account. You can also {{% resource_link "753619bf-1d21-489e-916f-545c40bed9a9" "download" %}} a copy of Sage to run on your own machine if you wish.
