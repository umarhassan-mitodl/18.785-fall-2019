[LMFDB](https://www.lmfdb.org/)
-------------------------------

The L-functions and Modular Forms Database is an extensive online database of mathematical objects arising in number theory, including number fields, elliptic curves, modular forms, _L_\-functions and more.

[Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/)
-------------------------------------------------------

Magma is a closed-source computer algebra system focused on number theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry. There is a handy [online calculator](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/) for quick calculations, and a command line interface that you can run from many of the math department servers (type **magma** at the command line).

[PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/)
------------------------------------------

PARI/GP is an open-source computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory. PARI is a fast C-library and GP is a script language interface to PARI that runs in an interactive shell (command-line only, no browser interface). Many Sage functions are implemented using PARI (you can directly call PARI and GP functions from within Sage). Like Magma, PARI/GP also has an [online calculator](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/gp.html) for quick calculations.

[SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)
------------------------------------

Sage is an open-source computer algebra system that includes extensive support for number theory. [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) (formerly SageMathCloud) provides a notebook interface to Sage that runs in any browser and is hosted in the cloud; no software installation is required and there is no cost to register for an account. You can also [download](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html) a copy of Sage to run on your own machine if you wish.
